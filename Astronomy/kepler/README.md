Kepler
======

Project directory for comparison of ODE solvers and usage of the solvers to integrate orbits of two point particles (Kepler's problem). A description of the integration methods, Kepler's problem, and instructions for completing this project is available on D2L.

Contents of this directory
--------------------------

* `README.md`  
This file

* `ode.py`  
Routines to advance solution by one timestep

* `kepler.py`  
Routines to integrate orbits and compute energies

* `error.py`
This is the file that we use to calculate the errors in our functions and plot them.


Report/closeout
---------------

1. Use the `wiki` for this repository to write a report of your findings. Make sure you address the questions in the instructions in your report.
2. Modify this README file by replacing instructions from me with your  instructions on how to run the code.
3. Send Dylan and I an email when you are ready to have your code reviewed.
