During my semester abroad at Michigan Sate University, I took a course on the physical structure of stars. As part of the curriculum, we were to deliver three group projects discovering different topics within simulating stars. All three projects where developed in collaboration with Cameron Blochwitz, Brendan Boyd, Trevor Franklin, and myself. 

## [Kelper](kepler)
Project directory for comparison of ODE solvers and usage of the solvers to integrate orbits of two point particles (Kepler's problem). A description of the integration methods, Kepler's problem, and instructions for completing this project is currently unavailable.

## [The life of a Main Sequence star](mainsequence)
Project directory for a model of zero-age, fully convective, low-mass main sequence stars.

## [The internal pressure of a White dwarf](whitedwarf)
Project directory for a model of white dwarf.
