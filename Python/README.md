A short description of the project in this folder.

### [Astronomy](Astronomy)

This folder contains the three group project I was a part of in my Astronomy class at Michigan State University. We were a group of 4 guys, where three of us had the responsibility of coding. The other group members' names are included in each of the projects. I wrote ~1/3 of the code.


### [Examples](Examples)

This directory consists of simple example files for different functionalities within Python. There are probably many more that
are useful to the general beginner, so updates will be coming.


### [FIFA](FIFA)
This is my first data scraping project, made with the help from:
https://towardsdatascience.com/master-python-through-building-real-world-applications-part-6-d05a7ea58a23

The project consists of three python files and a data set. player_ids.py, player_info.py and player_stats.py access player's
game stats from the 2018 World Cup in Russia, via fifa.com. The data sets are the respective .csv-files generating in those
files.


### [File Reader](FileReader)

The one python file in this folder reads a file and gives a list of the most used words. The idea behind this is to read my large gathering of notes and see what topics seems to always come up. A few others projects I feel I can use this for are scraping web searches to analyze the most common opinion of different websites. Could also be used when writing papers for school to make sure I don't keep using the same few words.


### [Google](Google)

I need to change the name of this folder. This project will follow a tutorial on creating a web scrapper/web crawler to start my own search motor.


### [Statistics](Statistics)

These files contain the different distributions I used in my introductory statistics course. There will be more to come, but maybe not in this folder. (This semester we'll be using R instead, but that folder won't show up here until late fall.)

### [TDS](TDS)

This directory consists of a To-Do station that can help keep track of tasks both in professional and private settings. See the
README in this directory for more information on how to use the program.
