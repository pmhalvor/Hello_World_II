Here are some examples of helper files I've made throughout the past few years.

### Corkboard
This is a todo list that creates four different text files (Idea, ToDo, WorkingOn, Completed) in the folder it's run in. These files are then used and updated every time a new task is created, deleted, or transferred between the different stages of completion. This was originally an idea I had to make in Java, but ended up using Python instead for simplicity. The Java corkboard is still under construction.


### Plot Data
Simple data plotting file that reads from a csv-file, and plots using matplotlib.

### Scrapping data
A file that pulls data from an url. Pulled from FIFA project

### Unzip
A file that unzips a zip download link.
