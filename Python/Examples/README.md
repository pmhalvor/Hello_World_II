Here are some examples of helper files I've made throughout the past few years.

### [Corkboard](http://github.com/pmhalvor/Hello_World_II/blob/master/Python/Examples/corkboard.py)
This is a todo list that creates four different text files (Idea, ToDo, WorkingOn, Completed) in the folder it's run in. These files are then used and updated every time a new task is created, deleted, or transferred between the different stages of completion. This was originally an idea I had to make in Java, but ended up using Python instead for simplicity. The Java corkboard is still under construction.


### [Plot Data](https://github.com/pmhalvor/Hello_World_II/blob/master/Python/Examples/plotdata.py)
Simple data plotting file that reads from a csv-file, and plots using matplotlib.

### [Scrapping data](https://github.com/pmhalvor/Hello_World_II/blob/master/Python/Examples/scrapping_data.py)
A file that pulls data from an url. Pulled from FIFA project

### [Unzip](https://github.com/pmhalvor/Hello_World_II/blob/master/Python/Examples/unzip.py)
A file that unzips a zip download link.
