# Hello_World_II

### ABOUT
This repository is a collection of the various projects I've worked on throughout my journey into the world of computer science.

## Examples
This directory consists of example files for each of the programming languages I've learn. They are definately not finished, but will they every really be finished?

## FIFA
This is my first data scraping project, made with the help from:
https://towardsdatascience.com/master-python-through-building-real-world-applications-part-6-d05a7ea58a23

The project consists of three python files and a data set. player_ids.py, player_info.py and player_stats.py access player's game stats from the 2018 World Cup in Russia, via fifa.com. The data sets are the respective .csv-files generating in those files.
