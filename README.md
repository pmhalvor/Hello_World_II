# Hello_World_II

This repository is a collection of the various projects I've worked on throughout my journey into the world of computer science.

## Python

### Examples

This directory consists of simple example files for different functionalities within Python. There are probably many more that 
are useful to the general beginner, so updates will be coming. 

### FIFA
This is my first data scraping project, made with the help from:
https://towardsdatascience.com/master-python-through-building-real-world-applications-part-6-d05a7ea58a23

The project consists of three python files and a data set. player_ids.py, player_info.py and player_stats.py access player's 
game stats from the 2018 World Cup in Russia, via fifa.com. The data sets are the respective .csv-files generating in those 
files. 

### TDS
This directory consists of a To-Do station that can help keep track of tasks both in professional and private settings. See the 
README in this directory for more information on how to use the program.
